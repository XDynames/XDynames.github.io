Fully Convolutional Networks
============================
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Long et al. showed that by adjusting state of the art convolutional neural network architectures traditionally used for image classification a network capable of per pixel labeling of images could be derived that enabled better than state of the art performance with a fraction of the inference time. This finding has been central to high performance semantic segmentation tasks since its publication.

Semantic Segmentation vs Image Classification
---------------------------------------------
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Traditional image classification problem involve ascribing a single label to an image that best encapsulates the object in the images name. Semantic Segmentation takes this classification one step further, extending the labeling to each pixel in the image. In this way output from a classifier will be an image per label which will indicate whether each pixel either belongs to that label or it does not. These channels which relate to each specific class can then be interpolated into a final image mapping the different pixels belonging to each class in the original image. Generally displayed with different colours relating to each label. The increased complexity of Semantic Segmentation is present in both the multi-label nature of the problem and that it much not only be able indicate that an object is present but maintain information about where that object is in the picture.

From CNN to FCN
---------------
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Adaptation of a convolution neural network to fully convolutional network requires modification to the classification layers in the original neural network. This is achieved by removing the fully connected layers and replacing them with convolution layers. In doing this the restriction on input size is lifted as a convolution transform can be applied to any tensor, generating an output coresponding to the kernel size and stride. Modification of this nature is applied to a pre-trained image classification model; exploiting transfering learning to provide a prior for relevent feature extracting filters that are fine tuned to the segmantic segmentation task. 

As input is passed through subsequent convolution and pooling layers, the tensor size shrinks. Due to this the forward pass is often refered to as the downsampling path. This pathway is predominantly determining what objects are in the image. The downsampled output from the full convolutional network is then subjected to an upsampling path to refund tensors matching the size of the original image. Restoring information related to the localisation of the objects in the image. These tensors are then combined forming a version labeled version of the original image with each pixel belonging to an object of a particular class.
