L. Chen et al. developed a network capable of high preformance semantic segmentation built using a deep fully convolution netowrk and in early versions a conditional random field. The architecture has been refined over time with several iterations, each achieving state of the art results on benchmarks at the time. The network itself makes use of atrous convolution to allow fast inference times in comparison to networks of similar depth, while maintaining a large receptive field size. The conditional random field acted as a post processing step on the convultional netowrks dense predictions to localise labels to boundries of objects in the original image. This step was discarded for versions 3 and 3+ in favour of an Atrous version of spatial pyramid pooling.

Atrous/Dialated Convolution
---------------------------------------------
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This form of convolution is anaogous to standard convultion with holes at speicific intervals in the filter the image is being convoled with. By allowing these holes the overall size of the convultion's filter can remain wide, capturing long range patterns in the image, without needing to store and update as many parameters as the filter is learnt. As an example a traditional 3x3 kernel could have a dialation rate or input stride of 2 producing a receptive field that would span a 5x5 section of the orginal image, while still using the same 9 parameters of the 3x3. An illistration of this example is seen below.
